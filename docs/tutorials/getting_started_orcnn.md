# Getting Started with ORCNN 
## Inference with Pre-trained Models
1. Pick a model and its config file from Model Zoo, for example
   [mask_orcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml](https://github.com/waiyulam/ORCNN/blob/master/configs/COCO-InstanceSegmentation/mask_orcnn_R_50_FPN_3x.yaml)
2. Run the Apply Net tool to visualize the results or save the to disk. For
   example, to use contour visualization for DensePose, one can run:
